## Side Bar Layout

> Prerequisites

If you have followed the steps from the beginning, you should have already created a reusable **ProfileCard** component. Let's use that in the side bar.

1. Create a folder with the name **SideBar** under **components/Body** folder.
2. Inside **SideBar** folder, create 2 files.
   1. Create **SideBar.js** - the react component file
   2. Create **SideBar.css** - the styles

> Inside **SideBar.js** file, copy paste the following

```js

```

> Inside **SideBar.css** file, copy paste the following

```css

```
